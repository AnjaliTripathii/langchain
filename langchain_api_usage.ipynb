Then, prepare the filling by combining fresh strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. The mixture is then poured into the crust and topped with another layer of dough. Before baking, brush the top with an egg wash and sprinkle with sugar for a golden and crispy crust. Once out of the oven, let the pie cool and set before serving with a dollop of whipped cream.
